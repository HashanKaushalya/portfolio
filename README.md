# Web dev 2 - Final Project â€“ Web Portfolio
### by Hashan Jayson Kaushalya

## Tell us about your process?

  1. According to our user expereince 1 course, before I started the wire frames I did look at some famous websites to get inspiration, I had to look and select atlease 03           websites and then analyse what's good things I can take from them to built our website
  2. Then after taking those ideas and inspirations I moved on to the low-fidelity wireframe section, where I drawn a sketch of our website will look like
  3. After that Wireframe stage I moved on to High-Fidelity stage where the images and icons and everything comes alive
  4. Then based on that High-Fi layout I started building the website wrote html code and bootstrap and css where it's necessary

## Challenges you faced during development?

- The main challenge I faced are how to look my website look appealing and make it above average. I had to look at couple of websites again and get some inspiration but since I have lack of content my major concern was what should I put in "Home" page? then what should I put in "project" page and how should I make it modern?

## How you overcame those changes?

- Even though I had a High-Fi wireframe I felt the content I had was not enough and (before doing this IMD course, I did some freelance work and I added some of the past work I did for my clients here as well as what I did in the class) that filled some of my content and interms of the backend I wanted to put some animation on the website which I reserached on youtube and google and added also I got some inspiration from famous Ad agency websites like "leo burnet" and "BBDO" 

## What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

- I have learned about bootstarp and how easy to use it. But it's good that we learnt html css first and learnt to walk before we started running(in this case using bootstarp) I beleive if we know the basics we can solve any problem.
